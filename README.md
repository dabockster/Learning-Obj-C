24 small programs to teach me Objective C

This is my attempt at using an online guide to teach myself the Objective C programming language. Although my end goal is to eventually write an app in iOS, I need to learn the language first. Hence the guide.

(The guide can be found here.)[http://www.binpress.com/tutorial/learn-objectivec-in-24-days/38]

All code is organized by the sequence of what is presented in the guide.
